# Everlytic Push Web SDK Sample App
This is a sample app that uses Everlytic's [Web Push SDK](https://github.com/everlytic/push-notifications-sdk-web).

## Notes
In order to get this sample app working, you will need to set up the Everlytic side of things, and get a hash to put into the init function of the Everlytic SDK. See the [Readme](https://github.com/everlytic/push-notifications-sdk-web/blob/master/README.md#getting-a-hash-from-everlytic) for more information.
